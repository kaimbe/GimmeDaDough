CS 3718 Term Project


This repository represents the submission that I made for my CS 3718 (Programming in the Small) term project. (Winter 2013 Semester)
My main goal for this project was to design and implement the back end of a typical ATM. 
The "docs" directory contains some brief documentation about the project.
